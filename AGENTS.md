# Agent Guidelines

- Use Python 3.11 standard library where possible.
- Prefer dataclasses and type hints for Python code.
- Ensure each module includes docstrings and examples.
- Follow BDD style in tests with clear Given/When/Then comments.
- Run `pytest` before committing.
- Keep commit messages succinct.
- Remove unused imports and fix warnings promptly.
