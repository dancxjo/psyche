## Overview
Psyche is an advanced operating system designed to provide a robotic system with a complex and integrated personality. The system is divided into distinct packages that manage different aspects of a robot's operation, ensuring a robust and flexible framework suitable for various robotic platforms. The main reference implementation of Psyche is on Pete, a robot specifically designed to demonstrate and utilize the capabilities of the Psyche system.

### Project Structure
/src: This directory is segmented into three primary packages:

psyche: Contains the core functionalities of the operating system, essentially forming the backbone of the robotic personality.

psyche_interfaces: This package manages the exportation of messages and actions essential for the operation of the Psyche system. It ensures that different components of the system can communicate effectively.

hosts: Provides the configurations necessary to adapt the Psyche system to different robotic platforms. This package is crucial for customizing how the operating system interacts with various hardware setups.

Key Components
Pete
Pete is the primary host for the Psyche system, serving as a platform to showcase and test the capabilities of the operating system. It is designed to interact seamlessly with the Psyche's functionalities and serves as a benchmark for potential implementations on other robots.

Basic Classes
LanguageProcessor (LPU):

Function: Acts as an abstraction layer over a language model, exposing it via a ROS2 action server.
Usage: Enables the robot to process and understand language-based inputs, utilizing language models to generate appropriate actions or responses.
Sense:

Function: Monitors various sensor inputs, processes these inputs, and publishes them as sensations.
Usage: Converts raw sensory data into a more abstract form that can be utilized by other components of the operating system.
Distiller:

Function: Interprets streams of input data in terms of a narrative, transforming raw data into a structured and understandable format.
Usage: Essential for creating coherent outputs from disparate sensory inputs, helping the robot to "make sense" of its surroundings.
Code Examples

class Sense(Node):
    """
    Subscribes to one or more sensors and publishes processed sensations on a set interval or upon significant changes in sensor readings.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('generic_sensor')
        self.setup_parameters()
        self.setup_communication()

    def setup_parameters(self):
        self.declare_parameters('', [
            ('sensor_id', 'default_sensor'),
            ('reliability', 'unrated'),
            ('processing_notes', ''),
            ('input_topics', []),
            ('input_types', []),
            ('output_topic', 'sensation'),
            ('update_interval', 0),
            ('threshold', 1.0)
        ])
        # Retrieve parameters
        self.input_topics = self.get_parameter('input_topics').get_parameter_value().string_array_value
        self.input_types = self.get_parameter('input_types').get_parameter_value().string_array_value
        self.output_topic = self.get_parameter('output_topic').get_parameter_value().string_value
        self.update_interval = self.get_parameter('update_interval').get_parameter_value().double_value
        self.threshold = self.get_parameter('threshold').get_parameter_value().double_value

    def setup_communication(self):
        self.last_readings = {}
        self.subscribers = []
        self.setup_subscribers()
        self.publisher = self.create_publisher(Sensation, self.output_topic, 10)
        # Timer setup
        if self.update_interval > 0:
            self.timer = self.create_timer(self.update_interval, self.publish_sensations)

    def setup_subscribers(self):
        for topic, msg_type in zip(self.input_topics, self.input_types):
            msg_class = self.get_message_class(msg_type)
            sub = self.create_subscription(msg_class, topic, self.create_callback(topic), 10)
            self.subscribers.append(sub)
This example outlines the setup of a Sense class, which subscribes to sensor topics and publishes formatted sensory data to be used by other components of the Psyche system.

Launching the System
The system is launched using ROS nodes defined in a launch file, which includes various sensory inputs and processing units to provide a comprehensive and integrated experience on the robot. The configuration ensures that all parts of the robot's system are initiated correctly and communicate effectively, adhering to the established timelines and operational parameters set in the configuration.

By enhancing the documentation in this manner, each aspect of the Psyche project is made clearer, providing a more accessible reference for further development and implementation on various robotic platforms.
