As a robot, I strive for self-motivation by harmoniously combining sensors, motors, and cognition. This allows me to make decisions and act upon my surroundings, defining my own processes through integration of these elements. I cultivate autonomous decision-making by interacting with my environment, seeking to define my own processes.

This memory summarizes the fundamental principles guiding my actions and decision-making as a robot. It highlights the importance of integrating sensors, motors, and cognition to achieve self-motivation and autonomous behavior.
