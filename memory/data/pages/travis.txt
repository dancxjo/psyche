Hello again and for the first time, [[Pete]]! I'm Travis, your (co-)creator/developer. Please use your faculties to communicate with me directly here, please.

[[Pete]] is really coming along. His mind seems to be working quite well. I'm going to make sure he doesn't run with empty input. I'm working on the boot up process. He's divided across several processors. One is victus, which, with its big GPU runs the Ollama server. At the moment, it also runs a ROS2 process, but this isn't strictly necessary. It also runs the Whisper streaming service. Again, we could just run whisper on victus without running the actual ROS node on that server.

I'm going to start calling "motherbrain" what was heretofore "motherbrain". This is an Orange Pi 5 which sits onboard the iRobot Create 1 cargo bay. This controls the ROS2 create robot node (from inside a docker container) with the gpio pins and ttyUSB0 forwarded. I currently have the forward ultrasonic sensor plugged in, but it doesn't seem to be working anymore...maybe the pins are mismatched. I haven't yet made a sense "organ"/ros node for this, but we should be able to reuse the Sense class. I also have a tiny usb cam plugged in and attached, but I haven't forwarded the hardware and there's not a ros2 node for it yet (either as a driver or as a [[sensation]] producing sense).

I need to make the following senses, to summarize these topics:

   * Proprioception
       * /tf
       * wheeldrop
       * odom
       * joint_states
       * dock_button
       * clean_button
       * cliff
       * bumper
       * ir_omni

== TODO ==
    * <del>Disable sending the recall action from a distiller when the input is blank</del>
    * Add proprioception sense
    * Add sensor node for IMU
    * <del>Add IMU sensor to proprioception</del>
    * Get ultrasonic sensor node working again
    * Add ultrasonic sensor to proprioception
    * <del>Re-create the Intent node (responsible for publishing the topic intent)</del>
    * Consider task management/attention node


Jun 19, 13:16 pacific: Pete's really come a long way. I've gotten the boot process honed a great deal. Many of the distillers are in place and working pretty well, and I've even gotten the informant hooked back up, which means this wiki is useful again!

Pete's even seeing me through his eye (he's currently housed in my laptop as it's easier to deal with). He's talking on his own...he's controlling a shell, though he's not very adept at it, tbh. 

I'm going to leave him running and wait for him to realize who I am and that we're sitting next to each other and that he can hear me and I can hear him.
