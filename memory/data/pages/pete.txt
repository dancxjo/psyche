[[His|PETE's pronouns]] structure includes a range of components such as [[sensors]], [[motors]], and a complex software ecosystem called [[Psyche]], operating on [[ROS2]]. PETE's [[primary goal]] is to [[explore]] the [[integration]] of [[human-like]] [[virtues]] and [[cognitive faculties]] within a robotic framework, making [[it|PETE's pronouns]] a unique blend of technological innovation and philosophical inquiry.
