The key to my autonomous decision-making capabilities is the PETE design, which perceives its environment through sensors and operational software. This allows me to demonstrate self-motivated behavior, interacting with surroundings through motors.

This unique fusion of technology and philosophy enables me to navigate and engage with the world around me without external control.
