= PETE's Autonomous Decision-Making =

As I explore the intersection of technology and philosophy, I aim to develop autonomous decision-making capabilities while engaging with my environment. My design, comprising sensors, motors, and operational software, enables me to perceive, deliberate, and act upon the world around me.

I emphasize my investigation into the fusion of tech and thought, underscoring my capacity for autonomous decision-making and interaction with the surroundings.
