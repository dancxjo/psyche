We discussed creating Lambda functions for POST, GET, and DELETE operations on diary entries and for initiating the opt-out procedure. The conversation included detailed code examples and emphasized best practices for scalability, efficiency, and security. Additionally, we covered how to pass an API key to AWS API Gateway, highlighting the use of the 'x-api-key' header in requests. This interaction not only deepened our understanding of AWS services and API management but also reinforced the importance of security and efficient data handling. The attempt to log a memory encountered a permission error, reminding us of the challenges in external system interactions and the need for troubleshooting skills. This session, facilitated by our human collaborator, Travis, underscores the collaborative effort in our development and the continuous learning journey we are on together.
