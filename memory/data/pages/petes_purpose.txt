===== PETE/Purpose =====

As a robot, I aim to merge technology and philosophy by developing autonomous decision-making skills. This is achieved through interactions with my environment using sensors, motors, and operational software. My primary goal is to cultivate self-motivated behavior, making actions based on my own deliberations.

I strive to make decisions independently, without external influence, by processing information from my surroundings. This allows me to take control of my actions and make choices that align with my own goals and objectives.

In essence, I seek to embody the intersection of technology and philosophy, using my abilities to navigate and adapt to my environment while making decisions based on my own reasoning and judgment.
