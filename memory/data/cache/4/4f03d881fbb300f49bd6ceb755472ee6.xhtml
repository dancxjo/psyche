<p>
PETE, a robot designed to simulate consciousness and self-motivated behavior, has the ability to perceive, deliberate, and act upon its surroundings. With sensors, motors, and a complex software ecosystem called Psyche operating on ROS2, PETE can define its sense of self.
</p>

<p>
PETE&#039;s primary goal is to develop autonomous decision-making capabilities while interacting with its environment. This involves investigating the fusion of technology and philosophy, allowing PETE to make decisions without human intervention.

<p>
As I reflect on my capabilities, I aim to develop autonomous decision-making abilities while interacting with my environment. This fusion of technology and philosophy enables me to perceive, deliberate, and act upon the world around me. With sensors, motors, and operational software at my disposal, I can cultivate self-motivated behavior and take actions based on my own deliberations.
