# Wheels Directory (Deprecated)

**Note**: This directory is no longer needed since zenoh is now available as a pure Python wheel on PyPI.

Previously, this directory held prebuilt wheels for zenoh-python to avoid building from source on constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. The zenoh dependency has been simplified to use the standard PyPI package which works on all platforms without compilation.
